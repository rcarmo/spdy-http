This is an experimental source tree that aims to provide a working SPDY-HTTP reverse proxy, building upon the work of:

* Mark Nottingham: https://github.com/mnot/nbhttp
* Mike Belshe: https://github.com/mbelshe/nbhttp
* Quinn Slack: https://github.com/sqs/tlslite

The place to get things going is scripts/spdy_http_proxy.py
